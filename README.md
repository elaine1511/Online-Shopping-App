# ONLINE CROCHET TOYS STORE APPLICATION

I have my small business to sell craftmanship crochet toys for children. I am selling on other platforms such as Shopify, Etsy and Amazon. 
I would like to build my own simple online store to serve as one of the selling platforms to catch more customers.

### I will design:
An e-commerce web application for sellers - admin of my store using React framework for frontend and AWS Amplify for backend to add the new products, delete or update products in the inventory, browser orders and send emmail to customers when their orders are received.
An online shopping application for buyers to shop our lovely handmade crochet dolls and make orders.

### Web Application Flow
Guest users can go to the website and they can see all the featured products. They can browse all products in the inventory.
Guests users can be able to add the products to the cart.
Guests users can search the products that they are looking for by using search bar on the product page.
Guests users have to be sign in/sign up before they can check out their cart.
Authorized users can see their orders history.

### Admin Groups
Admin account can see a admin panel with the view and add tab.
In the view tab, an admin can see all the products in the inventory. He/she can update and delete each product in the inventory.
Admin can see all the orders and fulfil the orders.
In the add tab, an admin can add a new product.
